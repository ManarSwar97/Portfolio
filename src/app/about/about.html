        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate software developer and fresh Information Systems graduate from the University of Bahrain, with experience in software engineering and data analysis. I build user-focused applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, React, and Angular on the front-end, and Node.js, Express.js, Python, Django, with MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL on the back-end.
        I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and creating applications that are both functional and impactful.</p>
